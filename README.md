libqtshadowsocks
================

Intro
--------------

`libqtshadowsocks` is a lightweight library for `shadowsocks`.

It is written in C++ using Qt5 frameworks. Therefore, the major purpose of this project is to provide a developer-friendly shadowsocks library, mainly for Qt applications, i.e. [shadowsocks-qt5] (https://github.com/librehat/shadowsocks-qt5/). While the `client` is sort of a demo to utilise this library.

Current Status
